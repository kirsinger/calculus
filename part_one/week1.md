# Calculus One
## Week 2 - Notes

Relationships ~ quantities connected together.

For example, quantity as input to machine, transformed to output.

Encoded as functions.

Limits ~ Make sense of application of function to a single point, 
and surrounding points.

### What is a Function
"A function assigns (unambiguously?) to each number in its domain 
another number"

How does does this assignment take place?

eg:
`f(2) = 4`
`f(3) = 9`
`f(4) = 16`
`f(5) = 25`

The function f makes various assignments.

Assignments can be described through a single rule.

`f(x) = x**2`

This describes how the function makes assignments.

Domain ~ the set of numbers a function can take as input.

eg for:

`f(x) = 1 / x`

The domain is all real numbers except zero.

Functions can be defined mathematically or in English.

Also using 'piece-wise' notation, for conditional output.

Functions must be specific (ie: no ambiguity about how the 
function assigns values to its input).

For a single input, a function will always produce a single output.

Two functions, f and g, are the same if for every input value, 
they produce the same output value.

This is not as simple as solving the definition of one function 
to obtain another. The statement of similarity must be made on 
the basis of the domain of each function (eg: consider 
f(x) = x**2  / x vs g(x) = x and the input 0)

Important functions:
* f(x) = x, the identity function, always outputs the input.
* f(x) = c, the constant function, always produces the same constant.
* f(x) = ax + b, linear functions
* f(x) = x**n for some fixed value of n
* f(x) = ax**3 + bx**2 + cx + d, polynomial functions
* f(x) = sqrt(x), square root functions
* f(x) = |x|, absolute value functions
* f(x) = sin(x), cos(x), tan(x); trig functions
* f(x) = log10(x), logarithmic function
* f(x) = 2**x, exponential function

Composition, output of one function becomes input of another.

eg: 

`f(g(x))`
